# Benefits of Next.js

## 1. Rendering

Next.js offers both client-side and server-side rendering:

- **Client-Side Rendering**: 
  - The entire HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files are sent to the client from the server.
  - The browser downloads these files and dynamically renders the pages.
  
- **Server-Side Rendering**:
  - The server sends a fully rendered HTML file to the client.
  - The browser then simply renders this HTML.

## 2. SEO Advantage

- SEO tools often face difficulties with dynamically rendered pages on the client side.
- Next.js offers server-side rendering, which enhances the speed of SEO crawlers and increases organic traffic by providing a fully rendered HTML page.

## 3. Routing

Next.js simplifies routing with its file-based routing system:

```
app
  ├── profile  (/profile)
  ├── about    (/about)
  └── contact  (/contact)
```

Each folder in the `app` directory can be accessed as a route.

## 4. Automatic Code Splitting

- Code splitting is a technique where large chunks of JavaScript files are broken down into smaller, manageable chunks.
- Next.js automatically splits the code into smaller chunks and loads them on demand.
- This improves app performance as the browser only loads the required files.
- It also enhances page load times since the browser doesn't need to load the entire JavaScript file at once.

## 5. Built on React

- Next.js is built on top of React and uses React components to build the app.
- This makes it easy to learn and use for React developers, as they can use the same React components.
- Next.js extends React, streamlining the development process by automating various functionalities.
